# Project 1 
*	Product analytics owner of bidding products. Defined key metrics across different phases of product life cycle; set up, scope, prioritize and align bi-monthly goals for cross-functional teams (analytics, product and engineer), and proposed data-based recommendations to influence them. Within 6 months, seized $AA million customer budget daily, and reduced BB% trading time to improve efficiency. <br>
*	Built structured and efficient SQL and Python based ETL analysis and visualization tools for monitoring, outliers finding, forecasting, and providing insights to corporate management team, reducing manual procedures for product operators from 3 hours to 1 daily, and decision window from 8 hours to 2 weekly
*	Created statistical definition of outliers, developed systematic methods to identify them, tracked the root causes, designed fixing algorithms and experiments with engineers, and acted on launch decisions based on statistical and domain knowledge. Spotting 20+ outliers, 3 experiments weekly on average, improved product performance (combination of CPA and budget spending ratio) by 45%. 
*	Improved upon existing mechanisms and algorithms by uncovering new data sources and fine-tuning model parameters, ideated, launched and reiterated 5 versions Auto-Bidding Algorithms. Constructed in-depth analytical projects, built machine learning models, measured customer LTV and conducted advanced feature engineering to develop customized algorithms and pitch plan, reducing acquisition cost by 30% and increasing LTV by 17%
*	Identified, scoped new opportunities and carried out industry research, helped set up Tourism and Shopping channel for Tik Tok, attracting 10k customers daily
